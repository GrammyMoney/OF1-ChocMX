# OF1-ChocMX
A Choc/MX-compatible OF1 board
# Howdy
Never done anything in GitHub, so I apologize for poor formatting. This is a version of the Open Frame1 board (original found here: https://github.com/GregTurbo/Open-Frame1) with Kailh Choc and MX compatible footprints. This is not designed to accept hotswap sockets, and it can only be used with the "Fast & Cheap" build listed in the original OF1 repo. Cheers!
